As you may have noticed, compared to other third-party PoE tools APT uses "Advanced Descriptions" key.

`Ctrl + Alt + C` is a frequent victim of global keyboard shortcuts. The sad part, if you are reading this, is that they used a dirty way to implement global shortcuts.

**Your goal is to make PoE copy the item to the clipboard when you press** `Ctrl + Highlight + C` (if it's already working, ignore this article, your problem is somewhere else).
