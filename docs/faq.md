- **Is this app approved by GGG? Can I get banned for using it?**

  There are no approved apps created by community. If app complies with the [game ToS](https://www.pathofexile.com/legal/terms-of-use-and-privacy-policy), does one server action per button press
  and doesn't interact with the game client itself (injecting into the process, changing the process memory aka cheats)
  it can be considered safe.

  If you get banned, the first action is to [Contact Support](https://www.pathofexile.com/support)

- **I want to `Ctrl + Scroll` stash tabs without zooming my character.**

  You can disable "Mousewheel Zoom" in PoE settings (Options -> UI -> 3-rd check mark starting from the bottom)

- **Will my language be supported?**

  No plans to support other languages. Why is there Russian language?
  Because:
    1 - this is the native language of developer;
    2 - helps to create cleaner abstractions in code and test it;
    3 - has the most active community, at least according to the numbers I can measure.

- **I downloaded a zip with a bunch of files, but no .exe inside?**

- **I can't price check items in Divination Card stash tab.**\
  **I can't price check rewards in Curio Display room (Heist Blueprints).**\
  **I can't check modifiers of the maps proposed by Kirac.**

  Yes, you can't. The game doesn't copy anything to clipboard when pressing `Ctrl + C` in these places.
  And as mentioned in the [Quick Start](/quick-start), the whole thing how
  app works based on text of item in clipboard.

  Regarding Divination Card stash tab, you can use another 3rd-party apps that
  price check your stash tabs (e.g. [Exilence Next](https://github.com/viktorgullmark/exilence-next/#readme))

- **What does the orange/red circle (next to the item's listed time) mean?**

  It shows player's status: AFK/Offline respectively.
